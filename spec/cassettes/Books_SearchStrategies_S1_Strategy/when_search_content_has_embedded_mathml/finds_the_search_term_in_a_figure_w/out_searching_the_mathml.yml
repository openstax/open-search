        and y intercept are at the origin. The second graph is of the function “f(x)
        = cos inverse (x)”, which is a decreasing curved function. The function starts
        at the point (-1, pi) and decreases until it ends at the point (1, 0). The
        x intercept is at the point (1, 0). The y intercept is at the point (0, (pi/2)).
        The third graph is of the function f(x) = tan inverse (x)”, which is an increasing

        then decreases until it hits a closed circle point at (-1, -(pi/2)). The function

        (x)”, an increasing curved function. The function starts slightly above the
        horizontal line “y = (pi/2)”, then increases until it hits a closed circle
        point at (-1, pi). The function then picks up again at the point (1, 0), where

        many areas of science, engineering, and mathematics, it is useful to know

        without breaking. If we have a function that describes the speed of a train,
        we would want to know its maximum speed before it jumps off the rails. Safe
