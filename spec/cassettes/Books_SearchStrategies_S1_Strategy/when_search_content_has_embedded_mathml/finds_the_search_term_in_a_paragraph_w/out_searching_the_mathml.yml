        and y intercept are at the origin. The second graph is of the function “f(x)
        = cos inverse (x)”, which is a decreasing curved function. The function starts
        at the point (-1, pi) and decreases until it ends at the point (1, 0). The
        x intercept is at the point (1, 0). The y intercept is at the point (0, (pi/2)).
        The third graph is of the function f(x) = tan inverse (x)”, which is an increasing
        curve function. The function starts close to the horizontal line “y = -(pi/2)”

        then decreases until it hits a closed circle point at (-1, -(pi/2)). The function

        (x)”, an increasing curved function. The function starts slightly above the
        horizontal line “y = (pi/2)”, then increases until it hits a closed circle
        point at (-1, pi). The function then picks up again at the point (1, 0), where
